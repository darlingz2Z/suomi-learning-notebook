## basic rules:
1. 字母与相同的音素对应 a given letter always corresponds to the same phoneme
2. 词尾构词法： 主干 + 词尾 Finnish morpholoy is the addition of endings to stems.
	1. 介词，后置词 Finnish case endings normally correspond to prepositions or postpositions in orther language.
		- e.g. auto-ssa -> car in -> in the car
		- auto-on -> car into -> into the car
	2. 独立的格 sometimes uses endings where indo-european languages generally have independent words.
		- kirja-ni -> book my -> my book
		- kirja-mme -> book our -> our book
	3. 某种程度的强调或语气词 intonation in some other languages
		- kirja-ssa-kin -> book in too -> in the book too
		- On-ko tuo kirja? -> (that)is (interrogative) that book -> Is that a book?
	4. 广泛使用拓词词缀构成新词汇，拓词词缀可再跟随格式后缀、所有格、语素等等 wide-ranging use made of derivational endings in the formation of new independent words/ Derivational endings can also be followed by other endings for nous; these include case endings, possessive endings and clitics.
		- kirja-sto(library)-ssa -> in a library
		- kirjo-sto(library)-sta-mme -> out of our library
	5. 没有冠词。通过结尾或者是特定的词序表达特指名词。
		- Kadulla on auto -> There is a car in the street.
		- Auto on kadulla -> The car is in the street.
	6. 通过名词主格(nominative)与 部分格（抽象的理型 partitive）或 与属格（与名词或时位词的关系 genitive）表达特指名词。
		- Nea joi kahvi-a (partitive case, object) -> Nea drank coffee
		- Nea joi kahvi-n (genitive case, object) -> Nea drank the coffee.
	7. 形容词与被修饰名词保持同样的后缀变化。
		- iso auto -> a/the big car
		- iso-ssa auto-ssa in a/the big car
		- iso-n auto-n of a/the big car
3.发音的长短会变成不同单词。
