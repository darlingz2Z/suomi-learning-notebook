1. In Finnish, the stress ALWAYS falls on the **first syllable**
2. Vowel Harmony -> front and back vowels can't appear in a single ***original word***:
	1. front vowels: near the front of your mouth, near the lips
		+ y
		+ ä
		+ ö
	2. back vowels: back in your mouth, near the throat
		+ u
		+ a
		+ o
	3. ***e*** & ***i*** -> natural vowels, in the middle of mouth. can appear with every vowel.
		- reikä (hole)
	4. If the wörd has döts in it, the ending will have döts töö.
	5. Gemination:
		- Long consonants: a little pause in the middle
		- example:
			- kukka (flower) -> kuk_ka
			- tuuli(wind) -> tuuuuuuuli
